        <h3> Directions</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>To a large pan, add the pasta, cover with 3 cups cold water, optional salt to taste,
                and boil over high heat until water has absorbed, about 10 minutes, but watch your 
                pasta and cook as needed until al dente. While pasta boils,brown the ground beef. </li>
            <li> To a large skillet, add the ground beef and cook over medium-high heat, breaking up the 
                the meat with a spatula as it cooks to ensure even cooking.  </li>
            <li> After beef has cooked through, add the pasta sauce, stir to combine, and cook for 1 to 3
                minutes, or until heated through.</li>
            <li>After pasta has cooked for about 10 minutes, or until all the water has been absorbed, 
                add the sauce over the pasta and toss to combine in the skillet or alternatively plate the 
                pasta and add sauce to each individual plate as desired. </li>
            <li>Optionally garnish with basil and Parmesan to taste and serve immediately. Pasta and sauce
                are best warm and fresh but extra will keep airtight in the fridge for up to 5 days. </li>
